## Week4
`2022.May.09, 11:00AM~12:15Noon`, with `Dr. Shuhao Cao`, `Ziheng Wang`, and `Deqing Jiang` at `Mathematical Institute`.
* The interface bwtween Quantlib and Transform
  * Sampling point format
  * Pre-process data format on our own
* The result of the PDE is in a stochastic way, which is totally different from the

</br> In order to get `v`, the `p` is what we want to solve, the transition density. It can be discribed by The Fokker-Planck Equation, which is 2 dimensions in space and 1 dimension in time.

* `#TODO` Problems still remains
  * How to define the input data format
  * How to define the final result of our model
  * Is there any advantage compared with the tradition method `Monte Carlo`?

## Week3

![Process](static/Process.svg)

* Problems remian in this week
  * Only a set of PDEs are suitable for Fourier Transform.
  * Why sample is `256*256` and downsample is `64*64`, what has downsampling done here?
  * How MCMC using FNOï¼Ÿ
  * To solve different PDEs, do we need to change the code in the FNO?
    * Or the info has been included in the dataset by sampling.
  * We need to solve a two dimensional difussion equation.

    * In the `class SpectralConv3d(nn.Module):`

  * How does the advantage of operator learning functions in this lab?
    * Does it not need to train again with different intial condition or boundrary condition.
    * Perhaps. As the Operator is learnt. So one of the three condtion has been solved, with the other two to be the intial condition and boundrary condition.
* Try with FNO for basic set up of the experiment.
* The FNO model for solving entire family of PDEs.
  * [FNO project](https://zongyi-li.github.io/neural-operator/)
  * [FNO GitHub](https://github.com/zongyi-li/fourier_neural_operator)
  * [FNO introduction](https://zongyi-li.github.io/blog/2020/fourier-pde/)
  * [FNO data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LfmrsIw6Wo_vbYhy3Azr4KVK8FeZDLT8?usp=sharing) 
  * [FNO models](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pxQeQhE-M9OGbVIHr35fid4CDquXFWa-?usp=sharing)
    * Here are the pre-trained models. It can be evaluated using eval.py or super_resolution.py
* By now there is no need to focus on the Galerkin Transformer, as it only provides a better precision on results.
* We will focus more on the FNO in the next stages.
* The FNO is more focused on solving a family of PDEs without try to train the neural network from the scratch, such as when the initial condition or the boundary condition change.
